/* Here is how the game works for reference:

The escape room requires three conditions to be met, occurring in three individually connected rooms located in a giant mansion.
In order to successfully win the escape room, you have only 30 turns to solve the room before you are trapped in the mansion forever.

Foyer-
The foyer is where the player starts the game. Inside the foyer is a bench, a chest, an unlit candle, and a note. There is a door to the north, but it is locked.
The note says, "May my light show you the way."
Inside the chest is a box of matches.
When you light the match, and then light the candle, the door to the next room to the north is unlocked, and you can move to the next chamber.

Library-
In the library there are stacks of books lining the shelves, a desk, a pen, and a scroll. There is another locked door to the north.
The scroll says, "Share your story."
When you search the bookshelf, there is an open book on one shelf titled "The Autobiography of..." with the rest of the title empty.
When you pick up the pen and write your name on the book, the door to the north opens.

Conservatory-
In the conservatory, there is a large door to the north that is locked. There are three instruments here- a trumpet, a drum, and a piano. There is a piece of sheet music on a stand in the center of the room.
The sheet music is empty, but it has this phrase written on the musical staff: "Timbre, Tone, and Time" representing the Trumpet, Piano, and Drum.
When the trumpet, piano, and drum are played in that order, the door to the north opens, and you are able to escape the room and complete the game.

The player can only input two-word verb-noun statements from a given list of verbs and nouns. There are also four directional commands (north, south, east, and west).

open
read
look
close
write
get
light

Nouns-

candle
book
trumpet
room
note
pen
piano
bench
matches
